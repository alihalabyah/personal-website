          Dear Mother,
        </span>
        <p>
          I know you wanted a card but I decided this year to do something
          different and save myself 99p and a stamp. Those stamp costs can really
          creep up on you yano.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nope, this year I decided to actually <strong>do</strong> something.
          It's too easy for me to go to the nearest shop and buy you a card that
          probably smells funny and looks like crap. Instead I built you this page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sure it's pretty simple, but according to a popular law coined by some unknown
          technical vagabond,
          mothers these days spend on average 128 minutes a day on their phones
          primarily browsing other peoples social lives on Facebook and feeding
          hoarding habits on ebay.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I don't know this guy personally, but if this law applies to you then
          I hope this page at least makes you open up that browser thingymabob and
          do something other than buying used toys and stalking your children on
          the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm only joking with you mother. Can you imagine me reading this to you?
          This would be a shit monologue wouldn't it. Anyway I guess I should actually
          get to the point.
        </p>
        <h2>Happy Birthday Mother!!</h2>
        <p>
          I know I won't be there in person but I'll be thinking of you. Enjoy it,
          and remember, you only turn 50 once.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wait, your not 50?! My bad.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway, I love you lots and enjoy your day.
        </p>

WordySwitch
===========

A small jQuery plugin for achieving the effect of revolving words.

## Example usage

See an example of it in action on my [website](http://connoratherton.com)

```
$('.element').wordyswitch({
  words: ['swicth1', 'switch2', 'switch3']
});
```

## Options
- **hoverSpeed** [int] Speed at which the words revolve when hovered over
- **normalHover** [int] Speed the words hover normally

## Disclaimer
I wrote this a while back when I was still learning so the quality could be better but
it works and that's the main thing.
